I will be doing 5 hours of coding tonight on my major project for college. Need to pack it up as soon as possible so that i can work on other stuff. Hence this agressive coding routine. My current github coding streak is of 48 days.   
As Linus says that you must make programming a habbit. Github is helping me maintain the habbit of programming regularly as i don't want to ruin my current streak. It really helps psychologically.
