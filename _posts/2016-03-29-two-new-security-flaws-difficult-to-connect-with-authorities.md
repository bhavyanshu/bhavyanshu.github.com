## What's going on?

I have reported new security flaws in two most popular gov websites. I tried to get in touch with concerned authorities via email on **Thursday, 24th March 2016** but I haven't heard from them till now. The security flaws have not been made public and will never be made public until I am sure they have fixed them. I am very much interested in getting them fixed but it looks like they are not. I am bothered about it even if they are not because it is putting user identifiable information at risk and anyone with malicious intent can harvest all that information. Your data can be sold to companies and there is nothing new in it. It's just more credible if that data comes from government sources (*seriously*). Their own policy claims to protect user identifiable information but the truth is that they are not trying hard enough to secure apps.

I have the disclosure reports ready and I have already told them via email that they should share their PGP key so that I can send them encrypted copies of the reports. I haven't heard from them till now. *I had to go public again and this is the part I hate the most*. If the concerned authorities are not interested, it becomes my responsibility to push them to take things seriously. So, [just like before](https://bhavyanshu.me/major-security-flaw-pm-app/09/29/2015#disclosure-to-officials), I had to get in touch with Mr. Arvind Gupta.

Just waiting for a reply so I can be done with this. I even have suggestions ready for them to quickly mitigate these problems. They just need to follow instructions mentioned in the disclosure reports and they will be able to fix these security issues. Also, I have written a [web app](https://github.com/bhavyanshu/openvid-sys) that can be dedicated for the purpose of better communication between researchers and concerned authorities. I can help modify it according to the needs of the government. This will surely help in future if someone wants to disclose vulnerabilities as it will reduce all these problems of communication.
