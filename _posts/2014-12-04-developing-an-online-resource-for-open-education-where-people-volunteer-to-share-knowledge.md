## What is this all about?

First of all, I have no grudge against any professor or teacher. I respect all those who have taught me, willingly or unwillingly. Secondly, by this post, I am also not saying that everyone in "education business" should stop making money. If you think that I am going into a debate that education should be a business or not, then you are wrong. This is not a debate in any way. This is just about an experimental project that I have started. 

## How it all started?

The only thing I have been thinking from quite some time is that what if given a chance to all the knowledgeable people to voluntarily share what they know, without any lure of money, will they actually contribute? 
From past few months, I have been working on a experiment of mine called [SlashSchool](https://slashschool.com). The service is near ready. Now you would ask "What's in it for me"? Let me explain why you should become a part of SlashSchool team. By the end of this article, I hope I am able to convince you to be a part of this.

### Why should you write content for SlashSchool?

Neither SlashSchool, nor I, own any kind of copyright on whatever content you create on SlashSchool. If you have created it, you own the copyright. The only restriction is the type of copyright. If you are putting it up on SlashSchool, you are automatically agreeing that the content (educational work only) becomes public and can be republished anywhere in any form and for any (even commercial) purpose. This is the freedom we give to all. Yet, you remain the copyright holder of the original content you have written. Also, any day if you come across a replication of the content you have written and don't find backlink to the original source of the content, you have the full authority to take action. 
Therefore, to provide freedom to users and to protect your rights over your content, we are using **CreativeCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License** for any educational work generated by the users on SlashSchool. Not all content generated by you is under this license. In fact, just educational works(like blog articles and tutorials) are under this license. The projects you display on SlashSchool have their own licenses.     
The license says that the replicator must acknowledge the original source (link to content on SlashSchool) with the Author's Full Name (link to SlashSchool profile). To make the acknowledgement a lot easier step for the redistributor, we have provided support for it right on the content itself. So wherever you will find the CC license, there will always be a "Get Author Acknowledgement Code" available, which you can use to get the HTML source of the license and it also keeps all the links intact. It looks something like this.

### Why not using CC-BY-SA-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0)? Why should others make profit out of my work?

I agree with Richard Stallman's article about [On-line education](https://stallman.org/articles/online-education.html) using incorrect licenses. If you don't have time to read it, then let me explain you quickly as to why I chose a *free* license but I suggest reading that first.
Indian Institutions which rarely ever openly distribute any work but when they do, they blindly follow American institution. Not saying everyone is wrong.        

> NonCommercial licenses donâ€™t rule out the possibility of commercial use, they just mean the copyright holder wants you to ask first, and possibly pay for the privilege. 
[Source](http://mollykleinman.com/2008/08/21/cc-howto-2-how-to-use-a-work-with-a-noncommercial-license/) - Written by Molly Kleinman        

The problem with CC-BY-NC-SA is that, for commercial use, you will have to individually and explicitly ask permission from all the people who have replicated the work in some way or the other. Over the time, on world wide web, people keep duplicating same content. Like most people do nowadays to remain on top of Google search results, it will be impossible to ask permission for commercial use from every person that has replicated the content. Hence, instead we go for a license that allows commercial use freely. Why? Because most educational works, have some practical importance as well. After all, teaching something should also have some practical importance. If someone learned something from the content you have published and they want to use it for practical purpose, they should be free to do so and not spend half their life asking permission from N number of people just so they can go on and build commercial products based on your work. You will still be acknowledged for that particular work because your license says so. If you still think that others should be restricted from commercial use of your work, then sorry SlashSchool is not a place for you. Why do we all want freedom to do anything we want to do and forget about it while giving someone else freedom to do anything they want to do? 

### Why you should write for free?

SlashSchool is not for "tech-journalists" who happen to copy paste lot of articles from other websites and publish them. The companies these people work for, often violate lot of copyright laws but no one bothers to point it out. Simply, because no one cares as long as they are getting the news.      
At SlashSchool, we are not doing any copy paste work and it's all about sharing what you know. If you are good at something, then share it with others so that others can learn too and gain a particular skill. It is also a place to connect with so many knowledgeable people. This is why we don't want to turn this into a business. This is the only way we can filter out *poseurs* from the group of people who actually are good at their field of expertise. No person, who only teaches for the sake of earning, will ever join an organization that does not offer him/her some sort of revenue generation mechanism. This way we will have all the bright minds actually working together on creating something useful which can help others and provide them freedom to use it the way they want to use it. This is what we believe science should be all about. Without monopoly, for the people, by the people.

### How do you decide the validity of content?

At SlashSchool, we use a term called CQR (Content Quality Rating). Suppose one person writes some post. Others find it interesting and informative, they can give it a particular CQR. It's like a voting system. At the end, the average CQR of the content is what matters. So the people generate the content and the people only decide which content is good and which is bad. 

### Will SlashSchool earn any profit then?

SlashSchool will never be a company. It is an experimental project. We will never make profit. We will never generate revenue. We will never have false corporate advertisements. No one is an employer. No one is an employee. We are all students, teachers, developers and researchers and volunteers who want to *freely* explore, discover and develop science. We just need some revenue to keep the services up and running. As I told before, SlashSchool has been built to provide open education to all. If we succeed in making this seemingly impossible experiment possible, we might be able to achieve a whole new level of openness. This will also prove that it's not really difficult to provide free education and we can encourage all the institutions to make their courseware open so that even the unprivileged can get access to them.


### If no money is involved, then how is SlashSchool running?

SlashSchool is barely standing as of now. I literally mean that. Currently it is hosted on Bluehost and it is using Cloudflare services for optimization. There is no rocket science involved in running it. We do need support.         
If all fails or i believe I am unable to support it, that will be the end of this project. Of course, all the users will be provided with a copy of the content that rightfully belongs to them and they can host it on their own.
