# Why I am interested in linux kernel?
>I am interested in it because i want to know how an operating system works. I am going to be using [2.6 kernel](http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git/) (stable) to study. I will be studying the code as well as the theory part of how this operating system works. What makes linux so fast and secure. Just doing it because i am curious. This being open source i can come to know how to contribute to the largest open source project because there is always a scope for improvement.
>You should really go through the pre-requisites in order to start off with learning the code of the linux kernel.

# What are the pre-requisites?
>Basically you should have knowledge of C programming, Operating system concepts, data structures, working experience with linux terminal console & should have been using git.

# How to start off?
>You should start reading "Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love". It is considered one of the best books for understanding linux kernel code. There is one more book "Linux in a nutshell by Greg Kroab-Hartman". It is another good book to get you started with.

# What are the important resources? 
>The home of the linux kernel is http://www.kernel.org. There you can find the latest kernel source code as well.
