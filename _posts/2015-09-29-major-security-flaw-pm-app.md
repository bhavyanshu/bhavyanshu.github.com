> Note that I am withholding details of the vulnerability to allow enough time for dev team to fix it. 
As mentioned above, I have disclosed vulnerability as well as exploit to developer team. 
If still they won't fix it by 7th oct 2015, considering the level of security flaw, I will have to proceed with publicly disclosing selective information regarding the vulnerability. 
Keeping in mind it's already affecting every user of the app, the information has to be made public in larger academic and security interest.

Will keep updating this page with more info. 

> Vulnerability disclosed to authorities on 30th sep, 2015 around 5:30 AM

<br>According to me, it is still vulnerable just like it was before. I can see no change at my end. Also, in last 24 hours, I have come up with a solution that will completely eliminate the vulnerability provided they implement it. Consulting [@pranesh_prakash](https://twitter.com/pranesh_prakash) as well regarding the solution.
