> Note that I am withholding details of the vulnerability to allow enough time for dev team to fix it. 
As mentioned above, I have disclosed vulnerability as well as exploit to developer team. 
If still they won't fix it by 7th oct 2015, considering the level of security flaw, I will have to proceed with publicly disclosing selective information regarding the vulnerability. 
Keeping in mind it's already affecting every user of the app, the information has to be made public in larger academic and security interest.

Will keep updating this page with more info.
